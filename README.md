# react_cruds_ci

It's an exercise to show my habilities.

I used mongodb, express and reactjs.

By running docker-compose file you can deploy the project. 

It can also be modified easier in a development environment using docker-compose_dev.yml file and uncommenting the 4th line of mongo.js file from back_end folder.
